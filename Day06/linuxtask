The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). Based on the requirements, perform the following:

Answer:

Step 1: Generate an SSH key pair

Press enter for all prompts . Default Location( /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa)


Private key: /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa

Public key: /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Step 2: Copy the public key to each app server 's sudo user

ssh-copy-id tony@app01

ssh-copy-id steve@app02

ssh-copy-id barmer@app03


Step 3: Verify the password less authentication

ssh tony@app01 - it should directly login without any password
