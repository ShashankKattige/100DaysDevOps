The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:



a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.


b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user



--------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer:

Step1:
sudo yum install -y cronie

Step2:
sudo systemctl enable crond
sudo systemctl start crond
sudo systemctl status crond

Verify the service status to see if it is running

Step3:

sudo crontab -e

Insert - */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
